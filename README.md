More Or Less Followers is a game to guess which accounts have more or less Instagram followers. Data is updated periodically from a wide array of top Instagram accounts, and games are randomly selected from those accounts.

We do not own any of the photos, posts, or other relevant information from Instagram.

## Code & Technologies

More Or Less Followers uses:

- React.js on the frontend with Tailwind.css
- PHP on the backend with data stored as JSON
- A Python data fetching system to get and update Instagram data
- This was my first time using Tailwind.css and fetching data from Instagram using the Instaloader package. These two tools were definitely interesting to expose myself to and get familiar with while developing this game.

## Other Repositories

 - The backend is located at [xtrp/moreorlessfollowers-backend](https://github.com/xtrp/moreorlessfollowers-backend/)
 - The cronjobs are located at [xtrp/moreorlessfollowers-cronjobs](https://github.com/xtrp/moreorlessfollowers-cronjobs/)
