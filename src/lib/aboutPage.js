# About

More Or Less Followers is a game to guess which accounts have more or less Instagram followers. Data is updated periodically from a wide array of top Instagram accounts, and games are randomly selected from those accounts.

We do not own any of the photos, posts, or other relevant information from Instagram.

### Code & Technologies

More Or Less Followers uses:

 - React.js on the frontend with Tailwind.css
 - PHP on the backend with data stored as JSON
 - A Python data fetching system to get and update Instagram data

This was my first time using Tailwind.css and fetching data from Instagram using the Instaloader package. These two tools were definitely interesting to expose myself to and get familiar with while developing this game.

If you'd like to take a look at the code, see [the GitHub repository for the frontend](https://github.com/xtrp/moreorlessfollowers-frontend). Other relevant repositories with backend and server code are linked there.
